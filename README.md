## About Me
Chicago-based and proudly a natural creature of winter, I thrive on snow, OSS, and just the right amount of chaos. Whether sipping Grand Mayan Extra Añejo or warding off cyber threats with a mix of honeypots, magic spells, and a very opinionated flamingo named Sasha (the BSidesChicago.org mascot), I keep things interesting. Honeypots and refrigerators rank among my favorite things—though my neighbors would likely disagree.
